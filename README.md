Step-by-Step Instructions

 

1. Download <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vitis.html">  Vitis 2020.1 </a> from the Xilinx website.

 


2. Set the properties of the Vitis download to allow executing as program



 

3. Install the Vitis software using the root privileges with the command:

 ```
 sudo ./Xilinx_unified_2020.1_0602_1208_Lin64.bin 

```

4. Once the Vitis Installation is complete Vitis will be available under the directory 

 /tools/xilinx

 


5. The next step is to download the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/xrt.html#gettingstarted"> Xilinx RunTime </a> from the Xilinx website. Please make sure you get the correct embedded (ZCU104 / Ultra96) or cloud (Alveo) XRT. Also make sure it is the correct XRT for your operating system.

 


6.  Download your platform from the links below:

<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html"> ZCU104 </a> 

<a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo/u50.html#gettingStarted"> Alveo </a>

7. Prior to installing the Xilinx RunTime we need to install the following packages by running the commands: 

 
```
sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-libopencl1

sudo apt-get install opencl-headers

sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```

8. Install the Xilinx RunTime using the command:

```
sudo apt install ./xrt_202010.2.6.655_18.04-amd64-xrt.deb
```

9. Using a terminal window in the opt/xilinx directory make a directory called platforms with the command: 

 
```
sudo mkdir platforms
```
 

10. Copy the downloaded platform file from the downloads directory into the newly created /opt/xilinx/platforms directory â€“ if the terminal PWD (present working directory) is downloads the command is:

```
sudo cp xilinx_zcu104_base_202010_1.zip /opt/xilinx/platforms
```
In this example, I have used the ZCU104, but you should see the platform you downloaded. 

11. In the platforms directory unzip the compressed file using the command:
```
sudo unzip -g xilinx_zcu104_base_202010_1.zip 
```
(This might take a few minutes) 


12. Download the <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms.html"> ZynqMP common image </a> from the Xilinx website.


13. Extract the downloaded ZynqMP common image into a directory 


14. In a file browser open the location of the extracted ZynqMP common image files


15. Select the file ###rootfs.ext4.gz### and extract this file into the same directory

 
16. Open a terminal window in the extracted ZynqMP common image directory and generate the SDK using the command:

```
sudo ./sdk.sh 
```

17. Select the desired directory for the SYSROOT


18. In a terminal window navigate to ###tools/Xilinx/Vitis/2020.1### and run the settings64.sh command:

```
source settings64.sh 
```

19. In the same terminal window as the setting script was source enter the command:

 ```
Vitis
 ```


20. This will open the Vitis IDE. As part of the loading process it will ask you the workspace you wish to work in. Select the directory you wish to use as your workspace.


21. Once Vitis opens select Create Application Project 


22. When the new project dialog appears click on Next


23. On the platform dialog you should see the platform you have just installed 


Congratulations! You now have Vitis and an acceleration capable platform installed and are ready to begin your development journey.
